To install anything go to Settings > Security > for developers and enable developer mode.

Next open PowerShell as admin and run this command: Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted.

Finally right click on the run-me-in-powershell.ps1 and run in PowerShell, alternatively
drag it on an open PowerShell window and run by pressing enter.
(For this you must navigate to appropriate location first)

Wait for a bit and your Microsoft Store should be installed with required files.

WHEN IN STORE PLEASE GO TO SETTINGS AND DISABLE AUTOMATIC UPDATES!!!
IF IGNORED IT'LL BREAK DOWNLOADS

NOTE!
Some users have reported errors with co-existing dependencies, if that's the case try to
manually sideload MS Store from the appx package if AppInstaller is in place.
