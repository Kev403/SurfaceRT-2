README!!

To install anything go to Settings > Security > for developers and enable developer mode.

Next open PowerShell as admin and run this command: Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted.

Finally right click on the install-store-and-dependency.ps1 and run in PowerShell, alternatively
drag it on an open PowerShell window and run by pressing enter.

If errors appear just run install-store-only.ps1 as that one skips dependencies!

Wait for a bit and your Microsoft Store should be installed with required files.

WHEN IN STORE PLEASE GO TO SETTINGS AND DISABLE AUTOMATIC UPDATES!!!
IF IGNORED IT'LL BREAK DOWNLOADS

ISSUE RELATING TO GITHUB FILE LIMIT. THE FILES FOLDER IS MISSING A STORE APPXBUNDLE DUE TO FILE SIZE LIMITS!!!
